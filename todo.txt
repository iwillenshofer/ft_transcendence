II.2 Security concerns 
Your website must be protected against SQL injections. 
Please make sure you use a strong password hashing algorithm
For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env
variables etc...  must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored by
git.  Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure
of the project.
 
II.3 User Account
The user should be able to add other users as friends and see their current status (online, offline, in a game, and so forth). 
Stats (such as: wins and losses, ladder level, achievements, and so forth) have to be displayed on the user profile. 
Each user should have a Match History including 1v1 games, ladder, and any- thing else useful. Anyone who is logged in should be able to consult it. 
II.4 Chat 
You also have to create a chat for your users: 
The user should be able to block other users. This way, they will see no more messages from the account they blocked. 
The user who has created a new channel is automatically set as the channel owner until they leave it. 
The channel owner can set a password required to access the channel, change it, and also remove it. 
The channel owner is a channel administrator. They can set other users as administrators. 
The administrators of a channel can ban or mute users for a limited time. 
The user should be able to invite other users to play a Pong game through the chat interface. 
The user should be able to access other players profiles through the chat interface.
